# Combinator

Allows to create all possible combinations, based on provided properties
and their possible values.

## How it works?

- Create properties (**unique names**!)
- Provide possible values for each property (**unique and not empty values**!)
- Press `Combine` button
- Look at all the possible combinations!

Yep, it is that easy!

And not much.
